# Design Patterns in Java

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

This repository contains implementations of classic design patterns in Java, following object-oriented design
principles. Each pattern includes:

- Java implementation with clear example
- Detailed explanation in its own README

### Behavioral Patterns

Patterns that deal with object interaction and responsibility distribution.

| Pattern         | Description                                                                                                                                               | Implementation                                                           |

| state           | Allowing an object to alter its behavior based on its internal state                                                                                      | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/state_pattern)           |
| Iterator        | Allowing access the elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation                                                               | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/iterator_pattern)        |                                         
| Strategy        | Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime                                                                                                      | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/strategy_pattern)        |
| Template Method | Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses                                                                      | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/template_method_pattern) |
| Command         | Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request                                                                    | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/command_pattern)         |
| Observer        | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically         | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/observer_pattern)        |
| Mediator        | Reduces chaotic dependencies between objects by restricting direct communications between them and forcing them to collaborate only via a mediator object | [View](src/main/java/design_patterns/behavioral/mediator_pattern)        |

## ðŸš§ Ongoing Development

This repository is under active development, with more design patterns being implemented regularly. Future updates will
include additional creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, along with real-world examples, performance
considerations, and comparisons between similar patterns. Contributions and suggestions are welcomeâ€”feel free to open
an issue or submit a pull request! Stay tuned for more patterns like Interpreter, Chain of Responsibility, and Null
Object, coming soon.
